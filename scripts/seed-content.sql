  '# PCB Design Guidelines

Creating a successful PCB requires careful attention to design principles and best practices.

## Basic Design Rules

### 1. Component Placement
- Place components logically
- Consider signal flow
- Minimize trace lengths
- Ensure adequate spacing

### 2. Routing Guidelines
- Use appropriate trace widths
- Minimize via usage
- Follow impedance requirements
- Separate analog and digital sections

### 3. Power and Ground Planes
- Use dedicated power planes
- Implement proper grounding
- Consider power distribution
- Plan for decoupling capacitors

## Advanced Considerations

- **EMI/EMC Compliance**: Design for electromagnetic compatibility
- **Thermal Management**: Plan for heat dissipation
- **Manufacturing Constraints**: Follow DFM guidelines
- **Testing Access**: Include test points and programming interfaces',
